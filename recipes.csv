Add the sugar, almonds, salt, vanilla and eggs and, still working on low speed, beat to blend the ingredients, scraping down the paddle and the sides of the bowl as needed. The dough may look curdled - that's all right. With the machine still on low, add the flour in three or four additions and mix only until the mixture comes together for form a soft, moist dough - a matter of seconds. Don't overdo it. To make the dough in a large-capacity food processor: Place the butter in the work bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade and pulse and process, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, until creamy. Add the confectioner's sugar and process to blend well. Add the almonds, salt and vanilla and continue to process until smooth, scraping the bowl as necessary. Add the eggs and process to blend. Add the flour and pulse until the mixture just starts to come together. When the dough forms moist curds and clumps and then starts to gather into a ball, stop! - you don't want to overwork it. The dough will be very soft, pliable and Play-Do-ish, more like your favorite butter-cookie dough than traditional pie dough - that's just the way it should be. To shape and chill: No matter the method you used to make the dough, gather it into a ball and divide into four pieces. Gently press each piece into a disk and wrap each one in plastic. Allow the dough to rest in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or for up to 2 days before rolling and baking. (At this point, the dough can be wrapped airtight and frozen for up to a month.) To Roll: 1. For each tart, place a buttered tart ring on a parchment-lined baking sheet and keep close at hand. Work with one piece of dough at a time; keep the remaining dough in the refrigerator. 2. Working on a lightly floured surface (marble is ideal), roll the dough into a round between 1/16 inch and 1/8 inch thick, lifting the dough often and making certain that the work surface and the dough are amply floured at all times. (Because this dough is so rich, it can be difficult to roll, but a well-floured surface makes the job easier. If you are a novice at rolling, you might find it easier to tape a large piece of plastic wrap to the counter and to roll the dough between that and another piece of plastic. If you do this, make sure to lift the top sheet of plastic wrap from time to time so that it doesn't crease and get rolled into the dough.) Roll the dough up and around your rolling pin and unroll it onto the tart ring. Fit the dough into the bottom and up the sides of the ring, then run your rolling pin across the top of the ring to cut off the excess. If the dough cracks or splits as you work (as it may, since it is so fragile), don't worry--patch the cracks with scraps (moisten the edges to ""glue"" them in place), and just make certain not to stretch the dough that's in the pan. (What you stretch now will shrink later.) Prick the dough all over with the tines of a fork (unless the tart will be filled with a runny custard or other loose filling) and chill it for at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator or freezer. Repeat with the remaining dough, if necessary. To Bake: When you are ready to bake the crust(s), preheat the oven to 350F. Fit a circle of parchment paper or foil into each crust (cut the paper large enough to extend above the top of the tart) and fill with dried beans or rice. To partially bake the crust(s), bake for 18 to 20 minutes, or until lightly colored. If the crust needs to be fully baked, remove the parchment and beans and bake for another 5 to 7 minutes, until golden. Transfer the crust(s) to a rack to cool. The Raisins:  Place all the ingredients in a small saucepan over low heat and cook, stirring, just until the raisins are soft and plump, about 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the raisins to macerate for at least 2 hours, or for up to a day. The Banana:1. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set it close to your range. 2. Peel the banana and cut it on the bias into slices about 1/8 inch thick. Toss the banana slices with the lemon juice to keep them from discoloring. 3. Melt the butter in a large heavy skillet, preferably non stick, over high heat. If you are using the habanero pepper, add it to the pan along with the butter, then remove it when the butter starts to bubble. Add the bananas and turn to coat them with the bubbling butter. Sprinkle the sugar over the bananas and cook, still on high heat, turning the bananas, until they are golden and caramel-coated. (You need to work over high heat so that the bananas caramelize rather than melt.) Add the black pepper, stir, and cook for 1 minute more; the bananas will be soft inside and caramel crisp outside. Transfer the bananas to the parchment-lined baking sheet and pat them gently on both sides with paper towels to remove any excess butter; cool to room temperature. (The bananas can be caramelized a couple of hours ahead of tie and kept at room temperature.) The Ganache: 1. Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 375F. Fill the crust, still on its parchment-lined baking sheet, with the raisins and all but a few slices of the banana. (You'll use the reserved slices to top the tart.) 2. Melt the chocolate and butter in separate bowls and cool each to 104F, as measured on an instant-read thermometer. (It's crucial to the creamy texture of the ganache that both the chocolate and the butter be 104F.) 3. In a medium mixing bowl, gently stir together the egg, yolks, and sugar with a small whisk; whisk just until the sugar is blended into the eggs, taking care not to beat air into the mixture. Switch to a rubber spatula and, little by little, gently stir in the melted chocolate; stir in concentric circles. Add the butter in the same manner--you'll have a glossy, perfectly smooth mixture; by incorporating the chocolate and butter slowly, you are creating an emulsion not unlike mayonnaise. Once mixed, the ganache must be used immediately, so quickly pour it into the crust. To Bake: Bake the tart for exactly 11 minutes--no longer--at which point the top will look a little dry around the edges but the center will be shiny and a little jiggly. Remove the tart from the oven and top with reserved slices of caramelized bananas. The tart is ready to eat as soon as it comes from the oven.
